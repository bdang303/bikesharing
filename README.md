## Overview of the project

This project utilizes Tableau to create dashboards & visuals to help paint a picture based of data on CitiBike usage in New York City. The dataset in focus contained data elements related to bike checkout & usage, trip durations, and gender. Based on the analysis of this data, the intent was to gather additional insights around: 

- How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
- A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

Based on the above, these insights will help inform a new location/city in which we might be able to launch a similar bike sharing program.

## Summary

Within a face paced metro area such as New York City, there are a few key trends that we were able to gather from the data set. Usage is of course much higher during th weekday at certain peaks (morning & evening). As for correlation between Female & Male usage, both demographics tend to utilize the bike sharing service in the same ways (duration, time of use, etc.) There are a couple of other key insights that could be gathered from the available dataset: 

- Which locations within the city tend to have the highest or longest trip duration?
- Are there certain pockets or locations within the city the male or female users prefer to utilize?
